README

  tif2dds is a command line tool designed to automate the process of converting
  image files from .TIF and .PNG formats to .DDS (DirectDraw Surface) using
  Nvidia's Texture Tools Exporter. The tool will feature an interactive
  interface with user prompts, allowing users to select specific options such as
  the desired .DDS format (e.g., BC1, BC3) if an image lacks alpha channel
  information.

  Workflow:
    
    1. Installation and Context Menu:
       During installation, the tool adds a "Convert to DDS" option to the 
       right-click context menu for .TIF and .PNG files in Windows Explorer.
       
    2. File Selection:
       The user right-clicks on one or more .TIF or .PNG files and selects 
       "Convert to DDS" to begin the conversion process. Each selected file opens 
       in a separate PowerShell window for conversion, which closes automatically 
       after processing, freeing up memory.

    3. Alpha Channel Prompt:
       If an image lacks an alpha channel, the tool prompts the user to choose the 
       appropriate .DDS format (e.g., BC1 or BC3).
       
    4. Conversion Process:
       Nvidia's Texture Tools Exporter CLI is used to convert the files with selected 
       settings, such as compression and mipmaps.

    5. Output Location:
       The converted .DDS files are saved in the same directory as the original 
       files, which remain unchanged.

INSTALL

  It is recommended to create a separate folder for the tif2dds related files.
  You can choose any location that suits you.
  
  Once you have downloaded the executable, follow these steps to complete the
  installation:
  
  1. Place the .exe file in the folder created before.
  2. Open PowerShell as administrator.
  3. Use `cd` to navigate to the folder where the .exe file is located.
  4. Run `.\tif2dds.exe` install
  
  During the first installation, you will be prompted to provide the path to the
  folder containing the NVIDIA Texture Tools Exporter file. This file should be
  named nvtt_export.exe. You can either enter the path manually or copy and
  paste it from the file explorer.
  
  If you have followed these steps correctly, you should see an output similar
  to the one below in your terminal:
  
  > ✔ Please enter the path to the folder containing Nvidia Texture CLI: ·
  > C:\path\to\cli Configuration file created successfully at
  > C:\tif2dds\tif2dds_config.ini Registering the context menu options...
  > Successfully added context menu for file type '.tif'. Successfully added
  > context menu for file type '.png'. Installation process completed
  > successfully!
